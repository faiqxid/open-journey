## 🎓 What I Learned

Building WeatherNow was an incredible learning experience! Here's what I gained:

- **API Integration**: Learned how to properly handle external API calls, rate limiting, and error handling
- **TypeScript**: Improved my TypeScript skills by implementing strict typing throughout the project
- **Responsive Design**: Mastered TailwindCSS utility classes and mobile-first design principles
- **State Management**: Gained deeper understanding of React Context API for global state
- **Performance**: Implemented debouncing for search and lazy loading for better performance
- **Deployment**: Learned how to deploy frontend and backend to different platforms

**Biggest Challenge**: Implementing the dynamic gradient backgrounds that change smoothly based on weather conditions. Had to learn about CSS gradients and animation timing functions.
